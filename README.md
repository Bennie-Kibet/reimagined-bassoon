# MOVIE PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS

**BY**:BENNIE KIBET

## Project Overview

The project analyzes

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. To create a new movie studio, they'll have to know the type of movies being currently watched and how they perform financialy. Doing this will help them get an edge on the competition. 

## Data

Tmdb and im.db databases have a long listing of relevant data needed. Each have data on the genre, title, ratings of various movies produced over the years. The datasets also provided other data such as the writers and directors.

## Results



## Conclusion

The analysis leads to the following recomendations;
1. On the genre of movie we can first release:
   1. Documentary,Music,Sport	
   2. Documentary,Music,War	
   3. Documentary	
   4. Comedy,Music,Musical	
   5. Adventure,Drama,War	
   6. Drama,Family,Musical	
as per data from im.db database 
2. That ratings generated depended on the number of people that voted and as such data with high number of votes and a high rating were considered in the analysis.
3. Apart from the two year in the 90s most of the recent movies were also popular and thus indicated that there are still people that watch movies

## Next Steps

Further analysis could help in identifying:
1. Best time for a movie to be released by the studio.This could use data from the box office to know period that movies are watched alot.
2. Predict revenue that can be made from the box office after release of the movie. This could help inform or change the approach used in advertising or promoting the movie.
